This project aims to manage multiple apps from a single source foundation.
According to the Google Play Console, 
apps must be updated periodically with the latest Android SDK version target;
otherwise, they will not be shown in the Play Console for updated apps.

    To address this issue and save development time, we need a consolidated solution since some apps may contain similar code content such as 
network calls, alerts, camera, or gallery functionalities.

    Given the updates in SDK and handling changes in technical and feature behaviors, as well as updating deprecated support libraries, methods, 
and native feature support classes, managing multiple apps in different timelines can lead to redundant efforts in replicating similar content updates.

    Therefore, a Modular Architecture with a Single Source Code Foundation, coupled with Version Control and Branching, can effectively tackle this problem.
This approach allows for efficient management of updates across multiple apps, streamlining development efforts and ensuring consistency while adapting to changes in SDKs and technical requirements.
